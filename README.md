This application utilizes data loaded from a CSV file using React hooks and visualized using Victory Charts and D3. 
The data, which was collected by The Wall Street Journal, examines the roles that race, gender, geography, income, etc. factor into likelihood of becoming a victim of police brutality and violence. Hopefully this helps in the fight for Civil rights. #BLM


Inspired by this [Victory example from Swizec Teller](https://codesandbox.io/s/3v3q013x36?from-embed) in [React for Data Visualization](https://reactfordataviz.com/).
